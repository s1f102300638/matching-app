## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Strong Passwords**
   - Use passwords with at least 8 characters
   - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
   - Avoid common passwords
   - Never reuse passwords

2. **Account Security**
   - Enable two-factor authentication (when available)
   - Never share your account credentials
   - Log out from shared devices
   - Review active sessions regularly

3. **Privacy**
   - Review your privacy settings
   - Be cautious about sharing personal information
   - Report suspicious accounts or behavior

### For Developers

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use strong, random secrets
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Use different secrets for each environment

2. **Authentication**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use HTTPOnly cookies for tokens
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Hash passwords with bcrypt (12+ rounds)

3. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs on the server-side
   - Sanitize inputs to prevent XSS
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Validate file uploads (type, size, content)

4. **API Security**
   - Use proper authentication and authorization
   - Implement CORS correctly
   - Rate limit API endpoints
   - Log and monitor suspicious activity
   - Use API versioning

5. **Database Security**
   - Use least privilege principle
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Regular backups
   - Sanitize database outputs

6. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Use `npm audit` regularly
   - Review security advisories
   - Pin dependency versions

## 🔍 Known Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures

✅ **Implemented:**
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- JWT-based authentication (64-byte secret key)
- CORS protection (strict origin validation)
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries with PostgreSQL)
- File upload restrictions (type, size validation)
- Input validation (email, password, age)
- Error message sanitization (production)
- **Rate limiting** (express-rate-limit v8)
  - General API: 1000 requests / 15 minutes
  - Authentication: 5 attempts / 15 minutes
- **Security headers** (Helmet.js v8)
  - XSS protection
  - Clickjacking prevention
  - MIME type sniffing protection
  - 12+ additional security headers
- **PostgreSQL database** (fully migrated from SQLite)
  - Proper indexing for performance
  - Foreign key constraints
  - SSL/TLS encryption (rejectUnauthorized: true)
- **Trust proxy configuration** (secure for Render deployment)
- Database indexing for performance
- Foreign key constraints

### Areas for Improvement

⚠️ **TODO for Production:**

1. **Token Storage**
   - **Current:** LocalStorage (vulnerable to XSS)
   - **Recommended:** HTTPOnly cookies
   - **Impact:** High
   - **Priority:** Critical

2. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - **Status:** Depends on deployment
   - **Recommended:** Force HTTPS redirect
   - **Impact:** Critical
   - **Priority:** Critical

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - **Status:** Basic implementation (via Helmet.js)
   - **Recommended:** Implement stricter, customized CSP headers
   - **Impact:** Medium
   - **Priority:** Medium

4. **Email Verification**
   - **Status:** Not implemented
   - **Recommended:** Verify email addresses
   - **Impact:** Low-Medium
   - **Priority:** Medium

5. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - **Status:** Not implemented
   - **Recommended:** Implement 2FA
   - **Impact:** High
   - **Priority:** Medium

6. **Session Management**
   - **Status:** Stateless JWT only
   - **Recommended:** Add session invalidation
   - **Impact:** Medium
   - **Priority:** Medium

7. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - **Status:** Console logging only
   - **Recommended:** Structured logging + monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
   - **Impact:** High
   - **Priority:** High

8. **Database Encryption**
   - **Status:** Transport encryption enabled (SSL/TLS)
   - **Recommended:** Add field-level encryption for sensitive data
   - **Impact:** High
   - **Priority:** High
